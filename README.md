# gifbot-whisk

Based on (http://blog.scottlogic.com/2017/05/22/gifbot-github-integration.html) a port of the same code to Apache OpenWhisk.

gifbot - always waiting, always listening, ready and eager to serve up animated GIFs! Just use the term `[gifbot:searchterm]` and the bot will get right back to you.

e.g. `[gifbot:surprise]`
